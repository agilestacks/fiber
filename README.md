## Kubernetes cluster cost metrics

Fiber is a Kubernetes operator to manage [Korral] cost collector deployments and [Prometheus] configuration.

For each Korral [custom resource](samples/korral.yaml) installed, Fiber do two things:

1. It connects to the cluster and deploys [Korral] cost collector that is configured to export cost metrics of that cluster.
2. It changes Promethes Operator [Prometheus resource] to add cluster instance to `korral` Prometheus job.


### Korral deployment

When new Korral resource is detected, Fiber connects to the cluster and installs [Korral]. It periodically checks for health via Korral Service `/ping` resource. If HTTP 404 is received then it will reinstall the Korral. Other return codes - including 3xx, 4xx, and 5xx, indicated the software is installed.


### Prometheus reconfiguration.

When new Korral resource is detected (or removed), Fiber changes Prometheus custom resource to add or modify `korral` job so that cluster Kubernetes API `/api/v1/namespaces/monitoring/services/korral:9797/proxy/metrics` is scraped. As there could be many clusters providing metrics to single Prometheus, each cluster get it's own `domain` metric label that is used by [Bumper] API / UI to filter timeseries.


### HTTP API

Fiber optionally works with [Bumper] that bridges Prometheus metrics and Korral resources to HTTP API.


### Status

Convergence status from the Fiber point of view (Korral `/ping`) and Prometheus point of view is posted back into custom resource under `status: {}` (are there cost metrics for the cluster? `up{job="korral", instance="<endpoint>"}`).
